# claw-config-skill-creator

A blueprint skill for creating **claw-config-specific** skills: conservative config operations with docs-first diagnosis, change control, and consistency guarantees.

## Interface

### Default: create (proposal-only)

```
/claw-config-skill-creator <new-skill-name>
```

Produces a complete **PROPOSAL** (file tree + full contents) for a new skill.

### Review: audit an existing skill

```
/claw-config-skill-creator review <skill-path-or-name>
```

Outputs a review report: issues, risks, and concrete edits.

## Hard parsing rules

- First token after `/claw-config-skill-creator` is either:
  - `review`, or
  - `<new-skill-name>`
- Any other subcommand-like token is unsupported → show help (in `references/HELP.md`) and ask the user to restate.

## Output contract

### Create mode

Must output:

1. Target skill name + intended trigger description
2. Proposed file tree
3. Full contents of every file
4. Any open questions (only if blocking)

Default is **proposal-only** (no writes).

### Review mode

Must output:

- Summary: pass/fail + risk level
- Findings grouped by category (docs-first, routing vs activation, apply gating, public hygiene)
- Suggested patch snippets

## Mental model (must be embedded in created skills)

A claw-config skill must clearly separate:

- **Routing**: `bindings` chooses which agent receives a message.
- **Activation / access**: `channels.*` gates whether replies happen (Telegram requireMention/allowFrom/groupPolicy/topics overrides).

## Docs-first index (portable paths)

Created skills must point to official docs using a portable repo-root placeholder:

- `${OPENCLAW_REPO:-~/repo/apps/openclaw}/docs/channels/channel-routing.md`
- `${OPENCLAW_REPO:-~/repo/apps/openclaw}/docs/channels/telegram.md`
- `${OPENCLAW_REPO:-~/repo/apps/openclaw}/docs/tools/exec.md`
- `${OPENCLAW_REPO:-~/repo/apps/openclaw}/docs/tools/exec-approvals.md`
- `${OPENCLAW_REPO:-~/repo/apps/openclaw}/docs/tools/elevated.md`

## Guardrails (non-negotiable)

- **Docs-first** for deep issues. No guessing.
- **Claw-config boundaries**: stay in config + ops; keep secrets redacted by default.
- **Plan-first defaults**: for any skill that can change config, default behavior must be plan/proposal; apply must be a gated follow-up step.
- **Rollback + verification + report**: require rollback pointer and a post-change report (what/verify/effective/risk).
- **Public hygiene**: no private absolute paths; no version-sensitive routing logic copied into skills—link to docs instead.
